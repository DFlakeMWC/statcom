A Martian walked into a lingerie shop.
Yes, Sir, how can I help you?
Oh, wrong place. I thought this was a Mars Bar. Bad Dad joke.


Venus: The Purple planet for Women
Venus is the only planet that spins clockwise so it's sun sets in the West and rises in the East. Just like my wife.

There are more planets.
